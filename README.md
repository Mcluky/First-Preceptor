# My first preceptor
This project covers my journey to learn about neural networks. This one in particular is about preceptors. Preceptors are 
somewhat comparable with a basic neuron of the nervous system. In this case, it receives some inputs and returns as a result 
a value of 1 or -1.

The goal of this is to make a basic and rudimentary preceptor which can later be a part in a bigger neural network.
